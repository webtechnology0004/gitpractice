Apply CSS to enhance the appearance and usability of the form.

Requirements:

Use appropriate HTML form elements (<input>, <label>, <select>, <textarea>, <button>).

Style the form using CSS to:

Align labels and input fields properly.

Add padding, margins, and borders for better readability.

Use colors and fonts to improve visual appeal.

Ensure the form layout is responsive using CSS techniques such as flexbox or media queries.

Include hover and focus effects for input fields and buttons.

Validate user inputs using HTML attributes (e.g., required, type).

Maintain accessibility by associating labels with inputs and using clear placeholders.

Expected Outcome:
